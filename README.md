# CSS Grid Practice Project

This is a simple project I created while learning **CSS Grid Layout**. It demonstrates how to build a responsive grid layout using HTML and CSS.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file containing the layout.
- `style.css` – CSS file where the grid and styling are defined.

## 🎯 What This Project Includes

- A 3x3 CSS Grid layout
- Custom styling with `hover` effects
- Use of `grid-column` to span multiple columns
- A responsive and centered design

## 📸 Preview

Each box inside the grid contains:
- A colored block (gray or blue)
- A heading with my name: Anaspathan-Dev
- A short paragraph for content demonstration

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. That's it — you’ll see the grid layout in action!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (CSS Grid)
